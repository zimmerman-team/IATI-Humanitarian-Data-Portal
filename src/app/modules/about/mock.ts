        '<p>The <a href="https://interagencystandingcommittee.org/grand-bargain-hosted-iasc" target="_blank">‘Grand Bargain’</a> is an agreement made by humanitarian donors and aid organisations to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of humanitarian action in order to get more means into the hands of people in need. It sets out 51 commitments, organised by thematic workstream areas: transparency; greater funding for local and national response; cash-based programming; reduced management costs; joint needs assessments; participation revolution; quality funding (earmarking and multiyear); and harmonising and simplifying reporting requirements. Enhancing engagement between humanitarian and development actors is an additional cross-cutting theme.</p> ' +
        '<p>The Grand Bargain was officially launched at the World Humanitarian Summit in May 2016. As at July 2019, there are 90 signatory organisations. </p>' +

HPG/ODI work on behalf of the Grand Bargain Facilitation Group to produce annual independent reviews of progress made against the commitments. Progress is measured through interviews and self-reports (see terms of reference at the back of the <a href="https://www.odi.org/publications/11387-grand-bargain-annual-independent-report-2019" target="_blank">third annual independent review for details</a>).</p>',

        '- accountability of donors and responders with open data for retrieval and analysis;',
        '- improvements in decision-making, based upon the best possible information;',
        '- a reduced workload over time as a result of donors accepting common standard data for some reporting purposes;',
        '- traceability of donor funding throughout the transaction chain as far as the final responders and, where feasible, affected people.',

        '<p>Launched in 2008, the <a href="https://iatistandard.org/en/" target="_blank">International Aid Transparency Initiative</a> (IATI) is a multi-stakeholder initiative and an international open data standard that aims to improve the transparency and openness of both development and humanitarian activities. IATI provides a mechanism for the regular, automated publication of open data on financial flows and also enables organisations to publish information on their project or programming activities, including information on monitoring, evaluation and results. When combined with different data, such as needs assessments and more contextual analysis, this kind of open information has the potential to drive better decision-making.</p>' +
        '<p>IATI aims to standardise and automate the exchange of data – it is not a ‘system’ or platform. It does not curate data, nor does it provide ‘statistics’, aggregation or analysis. It is a format that publishers can save their data to. This creates a pool of open data, in machine-readable format, that others can contribute to, draw on and use—perhaps most notably via visualisations, dashboards, tools and platforms, which will read and display the data. The actual content and quality of what is available through IATI depends on what publishing organisations are able or prepared to contribute.</p>' +
        '<p>Overall, 1000+ <a href="https://www.iatiregistry.org/publisher" target="_blank">humanitarian and development organisations</a>, including government donors, multilateral and UN agencies and international and local NGOs currently use the IATI Standard to publish information on who funds them, where the money goes and the impact or outcome of their activities.</p>',
